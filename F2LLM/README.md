## F2LLM

F2LLMs (Foundation-to-Feature Large Language Models) are foundation models directly finetuned on 6 million high-quality query-document pairs, striking a strong balance between model size, training cost, and embedding performance:

On the MTEB leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd among models of ~4B size, and 7th overall, while F2LLM-1.7B ranks 1st among models of 1B-2B size.

F2LLMs are fully open. Model checkpoints are available at:

- [F2LLM 0.6B](https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai/F2LLM-0.6B)
- [F2LLM 1.7B](https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai/F2LLM-1.7B)
- [F2LLM 4B](https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai/F2LLM-4B)

Training data is available at [F2LLM data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codefuse-ai/F2LLM).

### Train

In this repo we provide a streamlined and efficient script for training embedding models. To reproduce the training of F2LLMs, please:

- Setup environment following `requirements.txt`. We note that transformers>=4.51.0 is required for training Qwen3 models.
- Download data and backbone models from Hugging Face (we use Qwen3 models).
- Run `tokenize_data_qwen.py` to tokenize the downloaded data
- Modify model path, data path, and other arguments in `configs/config.json`.
- Start training with `accelerate launch --config_file configs/accelerate_config.yaml run.py --config configs/config.json`.

Note: we recommend setting `num_processes` to 1 in `configs/accelerate_config.yaml` and launch the training code once to generate cache for training data before starting the actual training.

For multi-node training, run on the main node:

```
accelerate launch --config_file configs/accelerate_config.yaml --num_machines N_NODE --num_processes N_PROCESSES --machine_rank 0 --main_process_ip MASTER_IP --main_process_port MASTER_PORT run.py --config configs/config.json
```

where N_NODE is the number of machines; N_PROCESSES is N_NODE\*8; MASTER_IP is the IP address of your master node, and MASTER_PORT is a port available on your machine (e.g. 6379).

On worker nodes, also run the above commmand but modify `machine_rank` accordingly.
